## Data Collection

### What We Collect: Nothing

QuickCite does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers. All data remains entirely on your local device.

### What Is Stored Locally

The following data is stored using Chrome's local storage API (`chrome.storage.local`) on your device only:

| Saved quotes | Text selections you choose to save |
| Source URLs | Webpage addresses where quotes originated |
| Source metadata | Page titles, authors, dates extracted from pages |
| Citation formats | Generated MLA/APA/Chicago citations |
| Settings | Your theme and export preferences |

**This data never leaves your computer.**

## Data Transmission

### External Requests

QuickCite makes limited external requests only for functionality:

| Service | Purpose | Data Sent |
|---------|---------|-----------|
| arXiv API | Fetch academic paper metadata | Paper ID only (from URL) |

No personal data, browsing history, or saved quotes are transmitted.

### No Analytics

QuickCite does not use any analytics services, tracking pixels, or telemetry.

## Data Sharing

We do not sell, trade, rent, or share your data with any third parties. Because all data is stored locally, we never have access to your saved quotes or browsing activity.

## Data Retention & Deletion

- **Retention:** Your data is stored until you delete it or uninstall the extension.
- **Deletion:** You can delete individual quotes or all data at any time using the extension's "Clear All" feature.
